00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today is the day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the Shuttle Challenger.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
19 years ago, almost to the day, we lost 3 astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But we've never lost an astronaut in the flight. We've never had a tragedy like this.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the Shuttle.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:47,000
But they, the Challenger 7, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We mourn 7 heroes â€“ Michael Smith, Dick Scooby, Judith Resnick, Ronald McNair, Alison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Krista McAuliffe.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We mourn their loss as a nation together.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
John F. Kennedy
