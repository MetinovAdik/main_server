{"text": " Today is the day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the Shuttle Challenger. We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss. 19 years ago, almost to the day, we lost 3 astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in the flight. We've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the Shuttle. But they, the Challenger 7, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly. We mourn 7 heroes \u2013 Michael Smith, Dick Scooby, Judith Resnick, Ronald McNair, Alison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Krista McAuliffe. We mourn their loss as a nation together. John F.
