0	10000	Today is the day for mourning and remembering. Nancy and I are pained to the core by the tragedy of the Shuttle Challenger.
10000	18000	We know we share this pain with all of the people of our country. This is truly a national loss.
18000	26000	19 years ago, almost to the day, we lost 3 astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground.
26000	32000	But we've never lost an astronaut in the flight. We've never had a tragedy like this.
32000	38000	And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the Shuttle.
38000	47000	But they, the Challenger 7, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly.
47000	62000	We mourn 7 heroes â€“ Michael Smith, Dick Scooby, Judith Resnick, Ronald McNair, Alison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Krista McAuliffe.
62000	67000	We mourn their loss as a nation together.
67000	69000	John F. Kennedy
